A lightweight UNIX-style shell implemented in C‚Äîsupports command execution, arguments, built-ins, and environmental variables. Ideal for learning process control, system calls, and shell fundamentals.

## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
* Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
* Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
* Who is Ken Thompson
* How does a shell work
* What is a pid and a ppid
* How to manipulate the environment of the current process
* What is the difference between a function and a system call
* How to create processes
* What are the three prototypes of main
* How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
* How to execute another program with the execve system call
* How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
* What is EOF / ‚Äúend-of-file‚Äù?
